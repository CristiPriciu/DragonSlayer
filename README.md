# DragonSlayer

My first javascript game

Click the attack button to roll a chance of 50% to hit the Big Bad Dragon for 1 to 5 damage. If you do more than 3 damage, you win!
This is my first Javascript game. Initially a project for Codecademy, i made it work on a browser, something Codecademy does not teach.
